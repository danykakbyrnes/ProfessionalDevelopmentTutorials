# Welcome to my repository of professional development tutorials.

Navigating the hidden curriculum in academia is no small feat. Having mentors willing to guide me through the opaque process was invaluable, and I hope to provide you with the same guidance! I have mentored many students across all career stages, which has given me some perspective on what has worked for me and my peers. In this repository, you'll find a worksheet (with more to come, hopefully!) to help guide you in your professional development during graduate school. These resources are designed to help you navigate academia, regardless of the career path you choose.
