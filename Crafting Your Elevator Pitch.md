Whenever I am introduced to new people, they often want to know who I am and what I do. Whether in a professional or personal setting, it's always handy to have a few memorized lines to succinctly describe your work. Elevator pitches are a brief but impactful way to convey who you are in a professional capacity.
## ### Why Use Elevator Pitches?
Elevator pitches are versatile tools that can be tailored based on your audience: laypeople, individuals with a technical background in unrelated fields, or scientists in your field. The information relevant to each group differs significantly. For instance, while a layperson might not be interested in the specific methods you use, a fellow data scientist might find that detail fascinating.
## Structure of elevator pitch
Elevator pitches typically follow a simple structure:
1. **Name and Branding:** Introduce yourself and how you want to be known.
2. **Research Question:** What question are you trying to answer?
3. **Methods:** How do you conduct your research?
4. **Significance:** Why is your work important?

Here is mine for fellow researchers:

> Hi, my name is Danyka, and I am a 4th-year PhD student. My research sits at the crossroads of hydrology and biogeochemistry. I aim to understand how anthropogenic use of nitrogen and phosphorus impacts rivers, groundwater, and the coastal ocean on large spatial and temporal scales. I compile large datasets from various sources and use machine learning models to identify patterns and drivers. Ultimately, my goal is to protect water resources where they are most crucial for people.

For Laypeople:

> Hi, my name is Danyka, and I am a data scientist currently in the fourth year of my PhD. My research focuses on the use of farming chemicals across the United States and their impact on river and groundwater pollution over the past century. I am passionate about data and use it extensively to understand human-environment interactions. My broad interest lies in protecting water resources, particularly in areas where water is crucial for communities.

One pitfall I always warn about is the is this idea, which I vehemently dislike, that we have to "dumb down" our research for lay people. This is often paired with "Explain it to your grandmother", which is patronizing and misogynistic... I have met many grandmothers that have done masters and PhDs... but I digress. So, don't aim to make things less complex, aim to use everyday language and focus on the broader impact to communicate your complex ideas.
## Prompts to Guide Your Elevator Pitch
The following prompts can be used to help guide you through crafting this paragraph for a desired audience. 
### Who are they?
1. Who is your audience and where does their expertise lie so you can tailor your word choice? 
2. What do you want your audience to understand about you in just a few sentences?
### Who are you?
1. Name (legal or preferred name)
2. How do you want to be known? (e.g., research label like "hydrologist" or skill label like "data scientist")
3. Do you want to be associated with a specific organization or institution? Mentioning it can help build context and aid memory.
### Delineating your area of expertise
1. Write down a few sentences to succinctly explain the issue you are researching?
2. What research question are your trying to solve? (careful for jargon!)
3. What tools to you use to solve your research questions? 
4. Why is this question important? What problem are you solving?
5. What makes your work unique?
### Big picture and helping them make a connection
1. What are some key words you can use to connect with your audience?
2. Is there any pertinent news or political discussion that can help situate your research in a broader context?
3. How does your work impact society, the environment, or future policies?
4. What are some significant findings you have found? 
5. Can you share how your research has already made an impact?
6. After your current research, what will you be doing? This is particularly relevant if you are exploring job opportunities.

Now, go back to the pitch structure and start filling it out using your prompts. You won't use everything you wrote down, but you should have all the information you need to build a few pitches.
