## What is a personal brand?
 A personal brand is simply the collection of your skills, experiences, and philosophy you bring to your research and workplace. Whether you are intentional about your curating your brand or not, people's interpretation of your research portfolio and their interactions with you are going to contribute to your brand. Since it will inevitably be built for you, you might as well play a part in shaping it.

Your brands are limited to your research topic. In curating your brand, you should think about your current area of expertise as well as where you want to end up. Aim to lean on your existing skills and expertise while expanding your knowledge to grow in the direction you desire.

## The importance of a personal brand?
This is going to bother some folks: to get your researched noticed, you need to know how to market yourself and your research. Whether this gives you the *ick* or not, the sheer volume of research being conducted today makes standing out extremely challenging.

Researchers from notable labs will struggle a lot less with this. I have noticed that these researchers will get more accolades and recognition. It's extremely inequitable. If your lab group lacks name recognition or you study a niche subject, creating a research brand can help you be noticed among your peers.
